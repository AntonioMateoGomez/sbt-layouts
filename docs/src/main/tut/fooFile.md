# New Layout

This is a test project that will serve us simply to have an idea of the disposition of the new styles to be implemented and the way in which the projects or libraries that use these new layouts will appear.
Then we will perform two simple exercises to visualize the new styles of layouts that we are going to implement.

## FunctionA

A simple For Comprehension exercise in which passing a `String` to the `stringLength` function, we obtain the length of the string, or None in case of not passing any value

```tut
import forComprehension._

  val funA = new FunctionA
  val resA = funA.stringLength("Our new awesome layout!")
```

## FunctionB

In this case we will check if the number that we passed to the `isEven`function is even

```tut
import forComprehension._

  val funB = new FunctionB
  val resB = funB.isEven(33)
```
